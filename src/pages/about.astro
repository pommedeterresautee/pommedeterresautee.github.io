<AboutLayout frontmatter={frontmatter}>
  <p>
    I’m Michael Benesty. I build source‑grounded AI for law and tax, and I
    write here when I learn something worth sharing—usually at the intersection
    of code, doctrine, and real‑world practice.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Engineer × Lawyer × CPA.</strong>
       I’ve been a financial auditor in New York (Constantin Associates),
      a tax lawyer in Paris (Deloitte), and now an ML engineer.
      Speaking statute, ledger, and GPU lets me turn legal reasoning into testable specs,
      editorial knowledge into retrieval, and requirements into tools professionals actually trust.
      My north star: systems that don’t bluff, cite their sources, and stand up to audit.
  </p>

  <p>
    By day, I lead R&amp;D at Lefebvre group, European leader in legal and tax publishing, where we’re shaping GenIA‑L, a
    cited, editorially‑anchored assistant for legal and tax work. In open
    source, I helped build XGBoost’s R interface (a strange but happy path for
    a former lawyer/accountant) and co‑created tooling like
    <a href="https://github.com/ELS-RD/kernl" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kernl</a>
    and
    <a href="https://github.com/ELS-RD/transformer-deploy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">transformer‑deploy</a>
    —because useful systems should be inspectable, reproducible, and easy to
    ship. Earlier, with SupraLegem, I learned a lot about what responsible
    legal open data looks like (and what it doesn’t).
  </p>

  <p>
    What you’ll find here: practical notes, design choices, and small
    experiments—written with the skepticism of an auditor, the precision of a
    lawyer, and the pragmatism of an engineer.
