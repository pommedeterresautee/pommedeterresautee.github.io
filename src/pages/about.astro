<AboutLayout frontmatter={frontmatter}>
  <p>
    I’m Michael Benesty. I build source‑grounded AI for law and tax, and I
    write here when I learn something worth sharing—usually at the intersection
    of code, doctrine, and real‑world practice.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Engineer × Lawyer × Accountant.</strong> I speak statute, ledger, and GPU. That
    mix lets me turn legal reasoning into testable specs, editorial knowledge
    into retrieval, and vague requirements into tools that professionals
    actually trust. My north star: systems that don’t bluff, show their
    sources, and hold up to audit.
  </p>

  <p>
    By day, I lead R&amp;D at Lefebvre Sarrut, where we’re shaping GenIA‑L, a
    cited, editorially‑anchored assistant for legal and tax work. In open
    source, I helped build XGBoost’s R interface (a strange but happy path for
    a former lawyer/accountant) and co‑created tooling like
    <a href="https://github.com/ELS-RD/kernl" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kernl</a>
    and
    <a href="https://github.com/ELS-RD/transformer-deploy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">transformer‑deploy</a>
    —because useful systems should be inspectable, reproducible, and easy to
    ship. Earlier, with SupraLegem, I learned a lot about what responsible
    legal open data looks like (and what it doesn’t).
  </p>

  <p>
    What you’ll find here: practical notes, design choices, and small
    experiments—written with the skepticism of an auditor, the precision of a
    lawyer, and the pragmatism of an engineer.
