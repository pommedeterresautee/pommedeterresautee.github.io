# Published my first paper about Trustworthy Predictive Justice

**Thesis:** predictive justice is only credible if both the **data** and the **code** are open to scrutiny. Black‑box “predictions” don’t meet professional standards for lawyers or judges.

In a large‑scale experiment on more than **18,000** decisions from French administrative courts of appeal (2012–2015), a supervised ML model (XGBoost) predicts outcomes in the immigration‑removal docket with **87.2%** accuracy *and* remains interpretable enough for legal professionals to audit. Among the practical signals: noting that a litigant has **legal aid** increases the likelihood of annulment, while the **identity of the presiding judge** adds little predictive power. The project releases the model, code, and annotated dataset openly so others can verify, reuse, and critique.
